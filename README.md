# lung_metastasis_CNV_landscape
### The project's goal is to study frequency analysis of types of gene alterations occured in the lung metastatic cancer. The metastatic cancer dataset was retrieved from cBioportal and centered towards copy number alterations/variations. The file type utilised for analytics was data_cna.txt and the file had values indicated per alteration types from -2 to +2 showing deep deletions and significant amplification respectively. Further research showed co-occurence of gene alterations together through binarization of the matrix.
