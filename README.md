# lung_metastasis_CNV_landscape
The objective of this project is to analyze the frequency and distribution of gene alteration types observed in lung metastatic cancer. The dataset was obtained from cBioPortal and focused specifically on copy number variations (CNVs). The analysis was conducted using the data_cna.txt file, which encodes CNV states ranging from −2 (deep deletions) to +2 (high-level amplifications). Frequency analysis was performed to determine the prevalence of each alteration type across genes, followed by matrix binarization to identify and explore the co-occurrence patterns of gene alterations within the metastatic landscape.
